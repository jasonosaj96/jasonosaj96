## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm a Civil Engineer with a Transportation specialization from NTUA, now pursuing a Master's in Data Science and working as a Data Scientist/Deep Learning Engineer since my undergraduate studies.

- 🔭 Currently contributing to exciting projects at [Synthetica](https://www.synthetica.ai/) and another soon-to-be-revealed initiative 🤫 
- 🌱 Focused on refining my expertise in custom code LLM agents, and occasionally participating in open machine learning competitions 🏁
